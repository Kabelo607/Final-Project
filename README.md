Python Final Project
COVID-19 Data Analysis and Vaccination Visualization

Project Description

This project analyzes COVID-19 pandemic data focusing on case trends, deaths, and vaccination progress across selected countries. It provides descriptive statistics, trend explorations, and visualizations to help understand the spread and control of COVID-19 through reported data and vaccination rollouts.

Objectives

Load and clean COVID-19 data from Excel sources.

Generate descriptive statistics to summarize key indicators.

Visualize trends in total cases, deaths, and daily new cases.

Calculate and analyze the death rate over time.

Explore vaccination progress through cumulative doses and vaccination coverage.

Compare countries by cases, deaths, and vaccination percentages using line charts, bar charts, and pie charts.

Provide insights into pandemic dynamics and vaccination impacts.

Tools and Libraries Used

Python: Main programming language.

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for coding and visualization.

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib: Plotting library for static visualizations.

Seaborn: Enhanced statistical data visualization.

openpyxl: Excel file reading support for Pandas.

How to Run / View the Project

Install required libraries using pip or conda, for example:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn openpyxl

Open the Jupyter Notebook file containing the analysis (.ipynb).

Update the file path in the code to point to your Excel data file.

Run each notebook cell sequentially to load data, perform analysis, and generate visualizations.

Optionally, modify the list of countries or columns to match your dataset's format.

Insights and Reflections

The visualizations reveal diverse COVID-19 progression patterns among countries, highlighting the importance of timely interventions.

Death rate calculations provide deeper understanding beyond raw case numbers, accounting for severity.

Vaccination rollout trends demonstrate progress, but also underline disparities between countries.

Data quality and completeness strongly impact analysis; missing values require careful handling.

Combining multiple charts like line trends and pie distributions enriches narrative clarity.

This project serves as a dynamic template to explore evolving public health data and can be extended with more granular or real-time datasets.
